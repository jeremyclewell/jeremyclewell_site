      <p>Welcome to the club! You will learn fast that being a runner means being a part of a larger running community. As you start training, you will find that you meet many fellow runners. No doubt they will want to share their running experiences, hear about yours, offer training advice, and wish you good luck. Well, we're no different from those fellow runners...and we want to help you, too. Here are some tips to help you get started with your running program:</p>
      <ul><li><strong>Be sure to warm up.</strong> Tight muscles are prone to injury (especially in colder conditions).</li>
      	<li><strong>Start slowly.</strong> This warms up your muscles and gets you used to the running movement. Moreover, easing your way into a pace is also encouraging -- people tend to run longer if they start out slower.</li>
      	<li><strong>Wear a watch.</strong> Start to learn your pace (how long it takes you to run a mile). Some miles will be faster than others. Figuring out your speed is valuable; you can learn which are your faster miles, you can allot the right amount of time for a run on a busy day, and you can seek running partners whose pace is the same as yours.</li>
      	<li><strong>Eat and drink for your run.</strong> Learn more about what and when to eat and drink in <a href="#" onclick="loadArticle($('#n1'), 'articles/nutrition/breakfast_of_champions.html', 1);" title="Nutrition">Nutrition</a>.</li>
      	<li><strong>Stretch after you run.</strong> If this is new for you, it is extremely important to let your muscles lean out after a run.</li></ul>
