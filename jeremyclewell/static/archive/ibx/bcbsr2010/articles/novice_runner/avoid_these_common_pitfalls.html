      <h2>Training checkup: avoid these common pitfalls</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">Varying your distances and cross-training can help you avoid a training slump or burnout. </p>

      <p>How you run is just as important as how far you run. Many new runners fall into one of the following traps:</p>
      <ul><li>You run too hard, too far, or both. It's easy to believe that the harder you run, the better you'll do. Unfortunately, this is a recipe for burnout. Remember, your goal is not to "outdo" your last workout but rather to workout at an effective level (e.g., target heart rate, distance, tempo run).</li>
      	<li>You never, ever vary your runs. Even a beginner's body will become accustomed to a daily routine and will put forth less effort for each workout. Try not to run the same run two days in a row. Tip: Vary something about your run every day, for example distance, speed, or hills.</li>
        <li>You're too faithful when it comes to running. Without some cross training, you're body will have a difficult time withstanding the demands of a long run. Take some time to work other parts of your body. Tip: Add 15 minutes to your workouts twice a week to train the weakest part of your body.</li></ul>
