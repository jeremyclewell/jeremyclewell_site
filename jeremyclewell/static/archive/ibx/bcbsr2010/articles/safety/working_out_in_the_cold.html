			Working out in the cold

			The cold weather doesn't have to stop your outside training, so wear the correct clothing and enjoy winter.

		<p>
			Cold weather doesn't have to put a freeze on your outdoor exercise program. If you take precautions, you can still work out when the weather turns chilly.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Wear the right clothing
		</h2>
		<p>
			Clothing is critical, says the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Although a double-thick cotton sweatshirt may seem like a good choice, it doesn't insulate nearly as well as synthetic fabrics such as polypropylene.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't overdress. You can overheat even in below-freezing temperatures. If you dress too warmly, you'll sweat a lot. Then, when cold winds hit, perspiration will rapidly evaporate, chilling you. You want to limit perspiration and keep it away from both your skin and the outside air.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Layering is key
		</h2>
		<p>
			The ACSM recommends that you wear a synthetic material like polypropylene against your skin. This will allow the sweat to pass through the fabric away from your body. The second layer should be wool or cotton to soak up moisture. The third layer should be chosen for its ability to keep the cold air out â€” something lightweight and artificial, such as Gore-Tex material. Layering also helps regulate your temperature. If you get too warm, you can strip off a layer.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Heads up
		</h2>
		<p>
			You can lose a tremendous amount of heat through your uncovered head, so wear a hat, cap, or hood.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your feet get cold first. Wear appropriate boots or shoes, insulate your feet with warm socks, and keep your feet dry. Water can cause body-heat losses up to 25 times greater than cold air alone. Because of the large surface area to volume, your hands are also more susceptible to cold. Choose mittens over gloves because the fingers can warm each other and the mitten decreases the exposed surface area.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Don't forget fluids
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you can see your breath, you're seeing moisture leave your body. So drink plenty of fluids, particularly if the air is cold and dry. Drink water before you go out, and bring some with you.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Don't overdo it
		</h2>
		<p>
			Cold is a stress on the body, and so is exercise. Together they may be too much for someone not in optimal health. Talk to your doctor before you start a winter exercise program.
		</p>
		<p>
			People who have diabetes, who take certain medications, or who are older adults are at greater risk for a drop in body temperature in cold weather.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Other cold-weather tips
		</h2>
		<p>
			Warming up before exercising is always important but even more so when it gets cold. If the weather is particularly cold, it's probably too cold for you to exercise outdoors. If you do have to go out in extreme cold, cover all exposed skin to prevent frostbite.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cold air doesn't damage the lungs. Even very cold air is warmed to body temperature by the time it hits the lungs. But for some people with asthma, cold air can trigger an attack.
