			Exercise: in sickness and in health?

		<p class="subtitle">
			No matter how faithfully you exercise, you may have to skip your exercise at some point because of illness.

			The day you wake up with a cold or not feeling well, is the time to ask: "Should I go ahead and exercise or roll over and get some extra sleep?"
		</p>
		<p>
			According to the American College of Sports Medicine, your answer should depend on the fever test and the neck check.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The fever test
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you have a fever, you should wait until you feel better. The cutoff point, many doctors say, is 100.5 degrees. Listen to your body, and take it easy if your body temperature is at or above that mark. If you work out when you have a fever, you run the risk of kidney ailments, heatstroke, and fluid balance problems as your temperature climbs even higher.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moreover, no cheating: popping aspirin to bring down your temperature or relying on the gym's air conditioner to keep you cool will backfire. Illness is a stress, and exercise is a stress. When you double up on the stress, your body will suffer.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The neck check
		</h2>
		<p>
			If your temperature is normal but you still feel under the weather, do the neck check to see whether you should exercise. If your symptoms are above your neck — sneezing, stuffy nose, and watery eyes — go ahead with your regular workout. But if your symptoms are below the neck — nausea, achy muscles, and coughing, all indications of the flu — you're better off laying low for a couple of days. If you work out when your immune system is compromised, you won't recover as well because a lot of the energy in your body is going toward exercise, not recovery.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just because you miss a workout or two when you're sick doesn't mean your fitness level will suffer. Once you pass the neck check and the fever test, you can exercise again — but listen to your body. Getting back to your routine will be easier than you think.
