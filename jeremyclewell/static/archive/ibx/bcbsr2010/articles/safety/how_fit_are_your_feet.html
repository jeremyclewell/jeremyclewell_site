			Safety and Prevention

		<h2>
			How fit are your feet?
		</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">
			Improve your performance by keeping your feet in top condition.

		<p>
			Consider the foot: Although we often plant our weight atop it for four hours or more each day, we seldom give it a second thought. Even aching feet may not get our attention. But don't ignore the pain: it is a warning sign.
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact, more than 300 ailments afflict feet, from bunions and heel pain to arthritis and hammertoes. The natural fat padding on the bottom thins over time; extra weight adds strain; neglected feet hamper exercise.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we get a little older, we have to select shoes with a bit better shock-absorbing quality. Most problems, recognized early, can be treated very simply.

		<h2>
			Add up your scores
		</h2>
		<p>
			<br />
		</p>
		<p class="bold">
			0 – 20 points:
		</p>
		<p>
			Congratulations! Your feet and ankles are very healthy, and you can maintain your active lifestyle and exercise regimen. With proper attention, your feet and ankles should remain healthy, but consider an annual podiatric exam. If you scored points for questions 4, 5, 9, 11, or 12, seek that exam sooner.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">
			21 – 40 points:
		</p>
		<p>
			Pay attention. Your feet and ankles are showing signs of wear, placing you in the moderate risk category. Although you can continue normal activities, you should strongly consider having your feet checked by your family doctor or a podiatrist, especially if you have or plan a rigorous exercise regimen or scored points for questions 4, 5, 9, 11, or 12.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">
			41 points or higher:
		</p>
		<p>
			Your feet and ankles are at high risk for long-term problems, and you should get a foot exam quickly. If you exercise, watch your feet and ankles until that exam. And if you haven't begun exercising, see your family physician or a podiatrist first.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if you scored well, this test is no substitute for a physical exam. If you're over 40 and smoke, or if you have trouble with your heart, circulation, respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, or an existing medical condition or injury, see a physician before beginning to exercise.
