			Muscle soreness

			Listen to your sore muscles when they beg for rest.

			There is no formula for what you can do to help your muscles recover from a race. The length of your recovery time will depend on your overall condition going into the race.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a few days after the race, expect your muscles to be sore and your body tired. The soreness you feel is caused by damage done to your muscles (the contracting and lengthening) during the race. You may even have delayed muscle soreness that can begin as late as two to three days after the race and last up to a few days.
		</p>
		<p>
			Helpful hints for treating sore muscles:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get extra sleep this week. Remember, your muscles repair themselves while you sleep.
			</li>
			<li>Roll a frozen plastic water bottle over your leg muscles.
			</li>
			<li>Stick to light activity and slow, gentle stretching.
			</li>
			<li>Get a massage.
			</li>
			<li>Soak your feet in cool water.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			The bottom line
		</h2>
		<p>
			You shouldn't resume running until your soreness has gone away. The cure for most post-race soreness and stiffness is REST. If, after about a week and a half, you still fail to feel better, seek professional medical help.
