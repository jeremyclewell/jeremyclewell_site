			Running is a great way to get in shape. However, it can also lead to injuries. Knowing about common injuries and how to prevent them can keep you on track toward achieving your fitness goals.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Running right
		</h2>
		<p>
			Try the following strategies to prevent injuries.
		</p>
		<p>
			See your doctor for a physical. Certain health problems may hamper your running performance and increase your risk of injury. Specifically, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other degenerative joint diseases can increase injury risk and should be addressed before you start to run.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you warm up before you run and stretch after you run, you can prevent some of the most common injuries. Begin each run at the pace of a brisk walk or gentle jog; cool down at the same pace at the end of your run. It's most important to stretch muscles that move joints. These include the calf muscle, which moves the knee and ankle, and the hamstring, which moves the knee and hip.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wear the correct shoes. Buying shoes at an athletic store where a salesclerk can help you choose a shoe that fits your foot type can also help prevent injuries.

		<h2>
			Common injuries
		</h2>
		<p>
			The following injuries are common among runners:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Achilles' tendinitis.</strong> This injury is characterized by dull or sharp pain along the back of the tendon, calf tightness, and early morning stiffness. Stretching can help prevent this injury. To treat it, rest until the pain is gone.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Plantar fasciitis.</strong> This injury is an inflammation of the plantar fascia â€” a thick, fibrous band of tissue in the bottom of the foot. Proper stretching can help prevent such an injury. Anti-inflammatory medication and ice compresses help relieve pain.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Shin splints</strong> (medial tibial stress syndrome). This syndrome is caused by overuse or poor conditioning and worsened by running on hard surfaces. This injury causes pain on the inside of the shinbone. Shin splints are treated by complete rest until the pain is gone, followed by changes in the distance and speed of running. Pain relief is aided by stretching, ice, and anti-inflammatories. Sometimes shin splints cannot be relieved by these procedures, in which case a surgical procedure, faciotomy, may provide relief.

		</ul>
