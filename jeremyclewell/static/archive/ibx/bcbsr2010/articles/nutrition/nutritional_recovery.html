      <p>After the race, your primary focus should be on rehydrating your body. On the day of the race, sports drinks were helpful to replace the fluids and salts you lost through perspiration, but after that first day, plain water  —  and lots of it  —  is all you need.</p>
		<p>Also in the days following the race, you should concentrate on filling up your energy stores. A balanced diet of complex carbohydrates to replenish your glycogen stores and protein to rebuild the muscle you broke down during the race will help you refuel effectively, ensure a quick recovery, and get you back out on the road in no time. </p>
		<p>For the first few days post race:</p>
      <ul><li>drink before you feel thirsty;</li>
      	<li>avoid caffeine and alcohol as they can have a diuretic effect;</li>
      	<li>drink water until your urine maintains a pale yellow color;</li>
      	<li>make sure you get protein to help your muscles recover  —  choose lean meats, low fat dairy, or beans and legumes;</li>
      	<li>indulge your food cravings moderately  —  the first few days after the race are not the time to diet.</li></ul>
		<p>How quickly you recover from the Blue Cross Broad Street Run depends on many factors  —  and your nutrition and hydration are key factors that can work together to help you recover better and keep you strong.</p>
