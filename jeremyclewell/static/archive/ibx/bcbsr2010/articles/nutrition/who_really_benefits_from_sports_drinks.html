      <h2>Who really benefits from sports drinks?</h2>
	  <p class="subtitle">Many sports drinks are on the market today, but are they better for you than plain water?</p>

      <h2>What are sports drinks?</h2>
      <p>Sports drinks are beverages designed to provide small amounts of various sugars (carbohydrates), which our bodies can use while exercising. They also improve hydration by replacing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride), which we lose as we sweat during exercise.</p>
      <p>Sports drinks were originally developed to aid athletes who were practicing for extended periods of time in the Florida heat. They were not intended for the recreational athlete or spectator. Sports drinks can help athletes stay hydrated, replenish electrolytes, and boost energy levels by replenishing glycogen stores. During exercise, our bodies utilize glucose from recent meals we have eaten or mobilize glycogen stores to fuel the working muscles. During longer exercise (exercise that continues past one hour), it is more likely that blood glucose will be used to help supply energy for the working muscles. Sports drinks can help improve endurance and enhance performance by preventing the depletion of glycogen â€” the number one cause of fatigue.</p>
      <h2>Who needs sports drinks?</h2>
      <p>If you're exercising for less than an hour, water is sufficient. If you're exercising for longer than that at a moderate to high intensity, you may want to consider a sports drink. Sports drinks have no purpose if you are just sitting and watching a game or if you're consuming them with a snack or meal. Ounce for ounce, they contain about half the calories and sugar of fruit juice or regular soda and can quickly add calories to your diet.</p>
      <h2>How do I choose a sports drink?</h2>
      <p>Look for one that contains 6 percent to 8 percent carbohydrate. The higher the carbohydrate content, the slower the rate of gastric emptying or speed at which food and fluids leave the stomach. Sports drinks that contain more than 8 percent carbohydrate may cause nausea, cramping, and diarrhea.</p>
      <h2>Is there a downside to sports drinks?</h2>
      <p>If you're not training for a marathon or exercising in the heat for an extended period, sports drinks may be doing no more than contributing excess calories to your diet. This can lead to weight gain.</p>
      <h2>What about water?</h2>
      <p>Water is still the best sports drink for those recreational athletes who are exercising less than an hour on most days. It's inexpensive, readily available, and doesn't have any calories. If you prefer a little flavor, look for "fitness waters" that provide the necessary fluid for proper hydration along with some flavor but few calories (10 calories per 8 ounces).</p>
      <h2>Avoiding dehydration</h2>
      <p>Our bodies are very efficient at cooling us down and regulating our body temperature by releasing fluid and electrolytes through sweat. Dehydration can be a major problem that significantly impairs performance. A loss of just one to two percent of body weight in sweat can reduce performance. Don't rely on thirst alone as an indicator of hydration. By the time you are thirsty, fatigue and dehydration have already set in, making it difficult to perform at a peak level.</p>
      <h2>How to stay well hydrated</h2>
      <p>These guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine will help keep you well hydrated during exercise:</p>
      <ul><li>Eat a high-carbohydrate (whole grain breads, pasta, cereal, and fruit), low-fat diet and drink plenty of fluids between exercise sessions. Avoid fluids that contain sugar, caffeine, or alcohol.</li>
      	<li>Drink 17 ounces (2+ cups) of fluid two hours before exercise.</li>
      	<li>Drink every 15 minutes during exercise.</li>
      	<li>Keep drinks cooler than air temperature and close at hand (a water bottle is ideal).</li></ul>
      <p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> If you exercise for more than 60 minutes, you should take 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrate per hour to delay fatigue and fuel muscle contractions. Sport drinks, bars, and gels are a good first choice, but simple carbohydrates, such as bananas, pretzels, or fig cookies work as well.</p>
