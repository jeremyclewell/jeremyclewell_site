      <p>Vitamin supplements promise the world, and it seems logical that with all the added training you're doing, your body would need some additional vitamin supplements, right? So what could be the harm in taking a few?</p>
	  <p>Before you pop a mega dose of anything, consider the following:<sup>*</sup></p>
      <ul><li>Even though training certainly puts added stress on your body, it doesn't increase your need for vitamins.</li>
      	<li>Believe it or not, all people (from elite athletes to couch potatoes) have the same vitamin needs.</li>
      	<li>What does differ from person to person are calorie and fluid requirements. That is why, as you train, it is important that you eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and <a href="#"  onclick="loadArticle($('#n6'), 'articles/nutrition/how_to_know_how_much_h20.html', 1);" title="Water Calculator">drink enough water</a> to help to ensure that your diet meets these increased needs.</li>
      	<li>High doses of some vitamins, such as A and E, can make you ill or may increase your risk of developing other health problems.</li>
      	<li>While a good multivitamin is considered to be relatively risk-free, most experts agree that it is best to get your vitamins from eating a variety of foods rather than taking pills.</li>
      	<li>Vitamin and mineral supplements are needed only in special situations, for example vegetarian diets or those who avoid an entire group of foods (e.g., never eat dairy products).</li>
      	<li>Always consult with your physician before taking more than the recommended dose of any vitamin or mineral.</li></ul>
