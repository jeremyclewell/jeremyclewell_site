      <p>You know that water is your best source of hydration. But did you know that the human body cannot store water and that it must be replaced and kept in balance daily? Take a few minutes now to calculate your individual hydration needs.</p>
      <ul><li>Divide your weight by half. If you weigh 180 pounds, you should try to drink 90 ounces of water per day. This is the amount of water you need to drink to make up for your normal daily activities. This doesn't take running into account.*</li>
      	<li>Add another 8 ounces of water for each half-hour of exercise that day. If you run for 45 minutes, round up to 16 ounces of additional water.</li>
      	<li>During continuous workouts of more than 90 minutes, your body may benefit from a sports drink; sports drinks replace electrolytes lost through sweat during workouts lasting several hours.†</li></ul>
