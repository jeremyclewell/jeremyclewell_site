      <p>How well you eat before a race will have a big affect on how well you perform during the race. Here are some tips and suggestions that will help you fuel your body properly.</p>
	  <h2>Two to three days prior to the race</h2>
      <p>Your diet should emphasize complex carbohydrates more than usual, with low amounts of fat and moderate protein.</p>
      <p>Drink plenty of water.</p>
      <p>Don't restrict your salt intake. Snacking on salted popcorn and pretzels will help keep your sodium levels up.</p>
	  <h2>Race day</h2>
	  <p>Eat a light, easily digestible meal three hours before the race (you may have to set your alarm clock for this one). Try bananas, oatmeal, or yogurt (avoid high fiber foods). If this will be too much for your stomach, try a sports drink instead.</p>
      <p>In the three hours before the race, drink only water.</p>
      <p>Don't try anything new; stick with food you know. Avoid eating the promotional samples at the start or finish line.</p>
      <p>Be sure to drink during the race — but don't try to gulp down water while you run. Stop at the water stations or at least slow down to a walk.</p>
	<h2>After the race</h2>
	<p>Continue to drink plenty of water.</p>
    <p>Eat a bagel or sports bar about 15 – 20 minutes after the race.</p>
    <p>Graze on complex carbohydrates for the next 24 hours.</p>
	<p>In the end, it's best to stick with what you know. If you want to try different food, be sure to give them a "test run" in the two weeks before the race.</p>
