     <h1>Gear Check</h1>
      <h2>Layering for comfort</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">The weather changes every day at this time of the year. Layering will allow you to adjust to the weather.</p>

      <p>There is no one best way to dress for running that will satisfy every runner. All sorts of factors and personal preferences come into play — do you run inside or out, during the day or at night — and each runner needs to decide what works best for him or her.</p>
      <p><strong>Clothes:</strong> Stick with fabrics that wick away moisture. Stay away from cotton, which traps sweat. If you run outdoors in the cold, three layers on the upper body and two on your legs are usually most comfortable. Make sure your top layer is weatherproof and breathable.</p>
        <p><strong>Hats and gloves:</strong> Remember, when you are cold, your body heat goes to your head, and your extremities (fingers) suffer. Wearing a hat and mittens can make the coldest days remarkably pleasant. Make sure that these are also made of fabrics that wick.</p>
        <p><strong>Socks:</strong> Just so long as your feet stay dry, one pair of socks should do just fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Shoes:</strong> Finding a running shoe that fits well and provides the support you need is critical to your success. A good place to start is at a store that specializes in running gear. More often than not, the staff will be experienced runners who will help you find the shoe that is right for you. When you go, consider taking a pair of your old running shoes with you (the worn tread on the bottom of your shoes says a lot about how you run).</p>
