     <h1>Gear Check</h1>
      <h2>What's in your bag?</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Pack smart and use the bag-check service on race day.</p>

      <p>Like many distance races, the Blue Cross Broad Street Run offers a gear check service for runners. This convenient service shuttles your gym or duffle bag from the starting area to the finish line.</p>
      <p>Not only does this mean that you can wear sweats before the start of the race, but you can also bring along some dry clothes, socks, and shoes for post-race.</p>
      <p class="bold">Things you might want to pack:</p>
      <ul><li>change of socks, shoes, or sandals</li>
      	<li>change of clothes</li>
      	<li>a hat</li>
      	<li>favorite sports recovery bar</li>
      	<li>sunglasses/sunscreen</li>
      	<li>wet wipes</li>
      	<li>tissues</li>
      	<li>extra safety pins for attaching the race bib</li>
      	<li>band aids</li></ul>
      <p class="bold">Things not to pack in your gym bag:*</p>
      <ul><li>money</li>
      	<li>cell phone</li>
      	<li>keys</li></ul>
      <p>* We realize that many runners need these items for race day. In those cases, we suggest wearing an elastic waist pouch (it's like a fanny-pack that doesn't bounce around) on race day. Also, while tying keys to shoelaces is a common practice of runners, please realize the risk you run of loosing your keys.</p>
      <h2>How to use the gear check</h2>
      <p>Look for the yellow school busses above the start line area.</p>
      <p>Bring your own gym or duffel bag for your gear.</p>
      <p>Mark your bag with the tag supplied on race day. Any bag that is not properly marked will not be accepted.</p>
      <p>Place your bag on the bus that displays the number that corresponds to your race bib. This system is designed to help you locate your bag at the finish area.</p>
      <p>At the finish, display your official race number to the volunteers and your items will be returned. Please be patient and courteous, as this is a big job for our volunteers to handle.</p>
