      <p>No matter what sport or athletic activity you pursue, conditioning will make you better at it.</p>
      <p>"Every athletic pursuit is a power event, whether it's hitting a ball or riding a bike up a hill," says Wayne L. Westcott, Ph.D., fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, MA "In addition to working on the specific skills of the sport, you also want to build up the power you need to get the job done faster, harder, and better."</p>
      <p>You increase your power in two key ways:</p>
      <ul><li>resistance training, such as working with weights, to build basic muscle strength;</li>
      	<li>stretching, to increase flexibility and improve your range of motion.</li></ul>
      <p>The benefits of stronger, more flexible muscles apply to any sport by giving you endurance and injury protection.</p>
      <p>"It's also important to maintain a good level of cardiovascular conditioning through regular aerobic workouts," says Dr. Westcott. Cardio training helps you process oxygen and produce energy at a higher level, so you can play your sport with less effort and for a longer period.</p>
      <h2>Creating power</h2>
      <p>Strength training and flexibility exercises work together to create a more effective driving action. This advantage is especially noticeable in baseball, golf, tennis, and other sports that involve brief, explosive activity. You'll see a measurable improvement in both force and range.</p>
      <p>One recent study found that golfers who did strength training increased their club-head speed by 2.6 percent. And those who also did flexibility exercises improved their speed by 5.2 percent.</p>
      <h2>Head-to-toe conditioning</h2>
      <p>"The best strategy is to condition all of your muscles, no matter what your sport," says Dr. Westcott. "Otherwise, the muscles you ignore become weak links and subject to injury."</p>
      <p>"You don't have to be an elite athlete to benefit from good conditioning," says Dr. Westcott. "Better strength and flexibility make the activity more enjoyable, no matter what your level of competition."</p>
