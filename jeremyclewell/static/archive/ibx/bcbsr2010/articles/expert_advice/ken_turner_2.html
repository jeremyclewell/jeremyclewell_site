      <p>Many people have asked how to get faster, and here is the answer: hills and speed work.</p>
      <p>To make yourself faster, you have to push your body beyond its current fitness level. As your base fitness continues to improve, challenging your body with a hill workout every other week and a speed workout on non-hill weeks will make your overall running condition stronger and more efficient.</p>
      <p>Below are two speed workouts my runners really enjoy. For the first, you will need to go to a track and use a watch to monitor your time. For the second, you will need to find a challenging hill (depending on your level of fitness, your distance and repetitions will vary).</p>
      <p>Before you try either of these workouts, make sure you warm up and <a href="#" onclick="loadArticle($('#n6'), 'articles/nutrition/how_to_know_how_much_h20.html', 1);" title="hydrate properly">hydrate properly.</a></p>
      <h2>Workout 1: track</h2>

      <p>* If you are a fast/advanced runner (8–minute milers or less), you can do the 200 meters faster on a track. But remember, your times must be consistent from the first 200 to the last 200. Meaning: if you start running 29 seconds for each 200, you have to maintain that pace for all.</p>
      <h2>Workout 2: hill repeats</h2>
      <p>Pick a hill that is challenging and do six repeats (run up the hill six times) at your 5K race pace. Beginning runners aim to run up the hill for 30–45 seconds, advanced runner can go for up to two minutes. Recover as you come back down the hill. Just as on the track, you want to be consistent with times and distance covered. If you run down the hill too fast, your body will not have enough time to catch its breath and the next repetition will be slower, so make sure you use your recovery.</p>
      <p>With both of these workouts, as you get stronger you can add time and distance to them. For example, the 200 meters can go up to 400 meters and so on. At maximum, go to one mile repeats.</p>
