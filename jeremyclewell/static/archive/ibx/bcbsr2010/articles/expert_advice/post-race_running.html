      <h2>Post-race running — when can I run again?</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Returning to top form takes time and patience.</p>

      <p>While it might be tempting to get right back out there running, don't shortchange yourself and skimp on giving your body the recovery time it needs. Some experts suggest one day of recovery for every mile you raced, thus ten days of no hard racing or running after the Blue Cross Broad Street Run.</p>
      <h2>Post-race activity schedule</h2>
      <p><strong>Monday:</strong> Rest, rest, rest. Take it easy today and give yourself the day off from exercise. You should consider going for a walk and doing some light stretches to help stave off any post-race stiffness.</p>
      <p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Moderately increase your activity and keep walking and stretching.</p>
      <p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Today you can continue walking or start jogging for the same number of minutes that you would normally run.</p>
      <p><strong>Thursday – Wednesday:</strong> Use the next seven days to return to your exercise program gradually. Consider cross-training, but don't push yourself too hard — you are still in recovery mode.</p>
      <p>After ten days of recovery and light exercise, you should be back up to speed and cleared to run again.</p>
      <p>Pre-run checklist:</p>
      <ul><li>you are well rested and hydrated;</li>
      	<li>all post-race soreness has subsided;</li>
      	<li>blister sites are pain-free;</li>
      	<li>you are injury-free.</li></ul>
