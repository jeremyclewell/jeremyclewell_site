      <p>While most of your time this month should be spent running, your efficiency may improve by lifting weights as well. You only need to hit the weights twice a week for about 30 minutes, but those 30 minutes are important. Don't worry about bulking up! The intense aerobic training that you runners do will not allow you to become “The Terminator.”</p>
      <p>Benefits of increasing your muscular strength:</p>
      <ul><li>You will be able to handle weight loads of greater intensity.</li>
      	<li>You may decrease the risk of joint injury and strains caused by overuse.</li>
      	<li>Improved running performance: You will be able to run longer and faster!</li></ul>
        
	<h2>Functional strength training</h2>
      <p>If you are just starting a strength-training program, keep it simple. I would recommend just a few upper and lower body exercises and core work using “functional movements.” Functional training means working the human body as one unit — with your feet on the ground.</p>
      <ul><li>Standing up</li>
      	<li>Working everything at the same time</li>
      	<li>Multi-jointed activities</li></ul>
        
      <p>By doing these types of movements, you work your core and increase your balance at the same time. Here are some suggestions to work into your program:</p>
	<p>Two sets (8–12 reps) of the following, twice a week:</p>
      <ul><li>Squats</li>
      	<li>One-legged squats</li>
      	<li>Lunges</li>
      	<li>Push-ups </li>
      	<li>Triceps dips</li>
      	<li>Standing bicep curls with free weights</li>
      	<li>Shoulder presses while sitting on a stability ball</li>
      	<li>Low rows using cables and from a standing position </li>
      	<li>Hamstring curls lying on your back with feet on a stability ball</li></ul>
	<p>Include these next two exercises (hold each for one minute):</p>
      <ul><li>A standing squat with your back against a stability ball, against the wall.</li>
      	<li>A pike pose (it's like the starting position for a push up) resting on your forearms or up on your hands.</li></ul>
	<p>In the end, just remember to have fun and pick exercises that work for you. It is so much more rewarding when you make the most out of “getting there.” </p>
