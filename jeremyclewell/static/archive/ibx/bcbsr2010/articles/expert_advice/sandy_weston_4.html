      <p>Well gang, the big day is almost here. And while you've spent the past months preparing your body for race day, I'd like you to take some time now to prepare your mind.</p>
      <p>It is normal to be anxious. Most things that you work hard for are scary when they come to a head. Try to remember that all your workouts, runs, time, and energy are with you on race day.</p>
	 <p>Anytime a negative thought or a doubt comes your way, bombard it with a positive one. Yes, we are back to our affirmations. Remember, positive thinking REALLY matters. You can control your thoughts. Fire back with all of your good feelings and affirmations.</p>
	 <p>Strong mind + strong will + positive thinking + staying focused = strong body, strong run</p>
	 <p>Enough said. You can and will do the race and you will do your bestâ€¦that is the beauty of running. You will go out there, your feet will hit the pavement, and your heart will begin pumping. With your head up and arms swinging, the thrill and excitement will kick in.</p>
	<p>You are going to do it and you are going to do great!</p>
	<p>All good things,</p>
