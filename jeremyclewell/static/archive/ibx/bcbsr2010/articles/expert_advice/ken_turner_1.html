      <p>Congratulations. You have decided to run one of most exciting and fun 10-mile races in America. Whether this is your first or your fifteenth, this is a race that works better when you run with a plan. I am here to help you create and execute that plan.</p>
      <p>The first part of your training requires that you use a watch. Using a watch while you run has its advantages. The first is when you begin a running program, you should never go for distance or speed: it should be time-based, meaning that your initial runs should be for a sustained time only. For example, a beginning runner training for a 5K race may have a goal of four miles a day. When you have never run, or are starting to run again after an extended period of time off, this is not a realistic goal. Using a watch on your runs and having a set time like 30 minutes per run is a better goal than trying to go for mileage. A watch has other advantages  --  if you are running on a marked course, you can time your miles/laps and have an idea of your average pace. Another reason for wearing a watch is that for a run to benefit your body, you must do it for a minimum amount of time; wearing a watch can help you gauge your progress.</p>
      <p>Beginning and intermediate runners can use the following training program to take them through the first four weeks of training.</p>

       <p>*LT pace: Lactate threshold pace is your 10K race pace per mile, plus about 20 seconds, or about 85% of your <a href="https://ecom.ibx.com/ibx/htdocs/wellness/online_tools/targetHeartRate.html" title="MHR calculator" onclick="return spawnWindow('standard' , this.href);">maximum heart rate (MHR)</a>. For beginners, this should be a comfortably hard, near race pace, with a steady, unvarying effort.</p>
      <p>Meter Math</p>
      <ul><li>400 meters = 1/4 mile</li>
      	<li>200 meters = 1/8 mile</li>
      	<li>Most outdoor tracks are 400 meters.</li></ul>
      <h2>Key terms for speed training</h2>
        <p><strong><a name="threshold"></a>Threshold:</strong> This pace is just above easy and right below hard. It's the pace that you should be able maintain for 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Fartlek:</strong> An athletic training technique used especially in running in which periods of intense effort alternate with periods of less strenuous effort in a continuous workout.</p>
        <p><strong><a name="interval"></a>"Interval:</strong> This training consists of running fast a number of times over short distances with a slow jog for recovery between the fast runs. During the fast runs, the body is at its VO2 max (when the body is working at it maximum oxygen consumption).</p>
