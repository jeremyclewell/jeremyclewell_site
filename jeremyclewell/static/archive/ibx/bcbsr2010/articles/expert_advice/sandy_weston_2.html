      <p>How is your program going? Are you getting in the miles? Are you cross-training? Are you eating to be a lean, mean, speed machine? And are you stretching?</p>
      <p>Right now, there is so much training to fit into your day. I know all of these questions are overwhelming, but remember: “It is all about balance.” Honestly, I think I find “balance” in my life about one day a year, but I refuse to give up trying to achieve it. It's that important to me. It is my mind-set.</p>
      <p>As fitness people, we know the importance of being in the right frame of mind. But do we practice it on a daily basis? Do we really believe it works?</p>
      <p>Positive affirmations such as “I feel great” really do work. (I know what you are thinking! How corny! My husband even says it's “goofy.”) Without getting too scientific, studies have shown that if you repeat positive sayings, your body will start acting positively as well. In other words, your mind is communicating with your body, and your body starts believing it.</p>
      <p>Every morning, my three-year-old son wakes up and says to me, "It's going to be a great day, Mom.” Some mornings, I completely agree with him. Other mornings, I don't, but I try to keep saying it, and  —  eventually  —  I get there. Admittedly, on some days it takes longer than on others, but I do get there.</p>
	  <p>So here's what I want you to do: Try using positive affirmations for a week, and see how you feel. I would prefer if you said it aloud, but it is okay just to think it. Writing them down is also helpful. I would like you to say them five times a day, minimum: when you wake up, mid-afternoon, before and after your daily workout, and before bed. On your off-workout day, just say your affirmations whenever you can during the day.</p>
	  <p>Here are some ideas for affirmations, but feel free to make up your own. Just be consistent. Trust me on this  —  it works.</p>
	  <p class="bold">When you wake up:</p>
      <ul><li>I feel healthy, happy, and fit today.</li>
      	<li>I have lots of energy today.</li>
      	<li>I can't wait to get my workout/run in!</li>
      	<li>The day is going to be great!</li></ul>
      
	  <p class="bold">Midday:</p>
      <ul><li>I am feeling full of life.</li>
      	<li>I feel so healthy today.</li>
      	<li>Man, life is good!</li></ul>
      
	  <p class="bold">Before working out:</p>
      <ul><li>What a great workout I am going to have today!</li>
      	<li>What a fun, fast run I am going to have today!</li>
      	<li>I am going to do my personal best.</li>
      	<li>Nothing can stop me now!</li></ul>

	<p class="bold">After working out:</p>
      <ul><li>I am so proud of myself.</li>
      	<li>I worked so hard.</li>
      	<li>That was an amazing run!</li>
      	<li>I did the best for me today.</li>
      	<li>I did my personal best.</li></ul>

	<p class="bold">Before bed:</p>
      <ul><li>It is going to be a great, energetic day tomorrow!</li>
      	<li>I am so happy with what I did today.</li>
      	<li>I am going to get a great night's sleep.</li>
      	<li>I am so grateful for my health.</li></ul>

	<p>I know it sounds corny and maybe goofy, but try it. Even if you don't yell it from the rooftops (you don't even have to tell anyone your doing it), I promise you that your workouts, runs, and days will only get better.</p>
	<p>High hopes,</p>
