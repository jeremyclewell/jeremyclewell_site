      <h2>The sleep-exercise connection â€” running low on sleep</h2>
	  <p class="subtitle">Research reveals what's so great about a good night's sleep.</p>

      <p>Sleep is an integral part of any training program. It may sound strange, but it is during periods of sleep that your body becomes stronger. Look at it this way: all training stresses your body. In turn, your body changes and adapts to the stress by becoming stronger. But your body makes these changes when you are resting, not during your training.</p>
      <h2>How sleep deprivation affects runners</h2>
      <p>A number of important hormones and chemicals use this downtime to regulate themselves. Recent studies have shown that your body needs 7 to 9 hours of sleep to reset itself.</p>
      <p>Of particular importance to runners is the effect of sleep on glucose levels. A week's worth of sleep deprivation (less than 6 hours a night) has been shown to impair, or slow, the body's ability to metabolize glucose by as much as 30 to 40 percent. Because your muscles need glucose to function, low glucose levels can cause you to run out of fuel during exercise.</p>
      <h2>Extra sleep</h2>
      <p>Be sure to give your body the rest and sleep it needs to keep up with the demands of training for the Blue Cross Broad Street Run. Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night. Plan to get an additional 30 to 60 minutes of sleep per day while you are training.</p>
      <h2>Sleep-loading</h2>
      <p>If you're like many runners, you may find it hard to get a good night's sleep the night before a big race. Thankfully, one night doesn't seem to have a negative effect on athletic performance. Just use the week before to load up on your Z's, and that sleepless night before the race won't slow you down.</p>
