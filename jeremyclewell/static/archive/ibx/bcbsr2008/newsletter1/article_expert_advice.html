      <h2>Belly Breathing &mdash; Catch your breath</h2>
	   <div class="innerImage"> <img src="/htdocs/custom/bcbsr2008/newsletter1/images/layout/expert_advice_1st_ed.jpg" title="Feature Article" />
        <p class="subtitle">Belly breathing is so easy, even a baby can do it.</p>
      </div>
      <p>There is an obvious connection between running and breathing. When they work together, they create an invigorating rhythm that sustains the runner. When they are out-of-synch, exhaustion, side-stitches, and shortness of breath take over.</p>
      <h2>The wrong way to breathe</h2>
      <p>Many runners breathe with their upper chests. They heave their chest up and down with each breath. When they are out of breath, they&rsquo;ll often put their hands on their hips to &ldquo;lift&rdquo; their chest in an effort to get a deeper breath. This upper-chest breathing uses a combination of muscles in the chest, shoulders, and neck. It takes more effort and makes shortness of breath worse.</p>
      <h2>Breathing the right way</h2>
      <p>If you watch a baby sleep, you&rsquo;ll see the baby&rsquo;s stomach rise and fall with each breath. Babies naturally breathe with their diaphragm (also known as belly breathing). Relaxing the abdominal muscles as you inhale gives your diaphragm more space to move down. As a result, more air can enter your lungs. Tightening the abdominal muscles as you exhale forces more air out.</p>
      <p>For runners, belly breathing helps prevent shortness of breath. It does so by increasing movement of the diaphragm. This helps you get more air into and out of the lungs.</p>
      <p>You can and should learn to breathe with the diaphragm again. Because you&rsquo;ll be using only one muscle to breathe instead of many, you&rsquo;ll use less energy.</p>
      <p>To belly breathe, follow the steps below.</p>
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Place one hand over the center of your stomach. Put the other hand on your upper chest.</li>
      	<li>Inhale and let your stomach move out. Your upper chest should stay still.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Tighten your stomach muscles and exhale.</li>
      	<li>Feel your stomach muscles move in (as if someone is pushing on your stomach).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Practice belly breathing three or four times a day.</p>
      <h2>Hint</h2>
      <p>It can be hard to start, or regain, control of belly breathing during a run. Imagine you&rsquo;ve been punched in the stomach or give a small cough &mdash; both will cause you to exhale with your abdomen and get you back on track.</p>
      <h2>Try this!</h2>
      <p>You can build strength in the diaphragm the same way you do in any muscle &mdash; by working against resistance. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered belly breathing, try a little weight training! Lie on the bed with a weight on your stomach and do a few minutes of diaphragmatic breathing. Start with a lighter weight, such as a bag of dried beans. Work up to a heavier weight, such as a small bag of flour.</p>
