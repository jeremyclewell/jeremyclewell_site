      <h2>Foot Care &mdash; Put your best foot forward</h2>
      <div class="innerImage"> <img src="/htdocs/custom/bcbsr2008/newsletter1/images/layout/novicerunner_1st_ed.jpg" title="Feature Article" />
	  <p class="subtitle">Follow the Golden Rule: Keep your feet clean and dry.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As a distance runner, your feet take a beating daily and, if not cared for properly, can become uncomfortable and unsightly. Give them a little TLC and they&rsquo;ll repay you with miles of comfortable runs.</p>
      <h2>Clean</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Wash your feet everyday and after every run. Be sure to dry between your toes. Use talcum powder, cornstarch, or foot powder to keep the skin between your toes dry.</li>
      	<li>Rub a thin coat of skin lotion on the tops and bottoms of your feet. Do not put lotion or cream between your toes, because this might cause an infection.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Clip</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Trim your toenails regularly with clippers after you wash and dry your feet. Trim toenails straight across and smooth them with an emery board or nail file. Do not cut into the corners of the toenail.</li>
      	<li>Use a pumice stone to smooth calluses after washing your feet. Pumice is a type of rock used to smooth the skin. Rub gently, only in one direction, to avoid tearing the skin.<br />NOTE: Do not cut off calluses. Your calluses are your protection against blisters!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Blister care</h2>
      <p>The moist and warm conditions inside a running shoe are perfect for blisters. If you find you are developing a blister, your goal is to keep it from getting bigger and avoiding infection.</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>If the blister is small, unbroken, and doesn&rsquo;t hurt, you can leave it alone. The best protection against infection is the blister&rsquo;s own skin. Simply protect the skin with a Band-Aid&reg; or over-the-counter blister pad.</li>
      	<li>If the blister is large and painful, it should be drained without removing the skin. You can drain your own blister or ask your doctor to do it for you.<br />To drain a blister:
      		<ol>
      			<li>Clean both the blister and a needle with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.</li>
      			<li>Use the needle to puncture the edge of the blister gently. Press the fluid in the blister toward the hole you made. Do not remove the flap of skin covering the blister. Gently smooth it flat over the tender skin underneath.</li>
      			<li>Wash the blister after you have drained it, and pat it dry. Apply an antibiotic ointment and a Band-Aid or over-the-counter blister cover. The ointment will prevent the bandage from sticking to the blister and may help prevent infection.</li>
      		</ol>
      	</li>
      	<li>If the blister has already broken, wash and dry it well. Do not remove the flap of skin covering the blister. Apply an antibiotic ointment and a Band-Aid or over-the-counter blister cover.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preventing blisters</h2>
      <p>Wear socks made from polypropylene or other new synthetics. They wick moisture away from the skin more effectively than wool or cotton.</p>
      <p>Keep your feet dry during runs. Try to avoid puddles and running through a &ldquo;spray station&rdquo; on race day.</p>
      <h2>Toenail care (a.k.a. separation anxiety)</h2>
      <p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a runner to find a toenail (or two) has separated from the nail bed. And while often this is just an unpleasant side effect of running, there are some things you can do to prevent your nails from separating or lifting.</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Make sure your shoes fit well. Shoes that are too large or small can cause repetitive &ldquo;toe stubbing.&rdquo;</li>
      	<li>Keep toenails well trimmed. Overgrown toenails can catch on the inside of the shoe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your nail has turned black, but has not separated from the nail bed, the best thing to do is keep it clean and let the dead nail grow out.</p>
      <p>If your nail has separated from the nail bed, the usual treatment involves removing the nail, keeping the area dry to prevent infection, and waiting for a new nail to grow. If there is an infection, that will also need to be treated. Do not attempt to remove your own toenail; best to let your physician handle it.</p>
      <p>Once a nail separates from the nail bed, it will not reattach. A new nail will have to grow back in its place. Nails grow back slowly. It can take 12 to 18 months for a toenail to grow back.</p>
      <p>Note: If at any time your nail becomes painful, swollen, or infected, consult your health care provider.</p>
