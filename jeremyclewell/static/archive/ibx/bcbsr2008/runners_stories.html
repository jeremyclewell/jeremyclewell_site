			I dedicate each Broad Street Run to the memory of my father, Vincent J. Boyce.  He grew up near Broad and Leigh and attended Roman Catholic High School.  My father is in my thoughts every day however passing the places of his childhood during the Broad Street Run makes it that much more special.  It&rsquo;s a great event and one that I look forward to very year.</p>

			<p>Two and a half years ago, I was 43 years old and weighed 303 pounds. Today, I am below 200 pounds because of hard work, Weight Watchers, and working out.</p>
			<p>Friends encouraged me to run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run this year and I am training. The other day I ran eight miles. Who would have thought that in two years I could go from the couch to eight miles? On May 4, I will run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run. Ten miles is my goal, but as I told my friend, this is for the long term. Ten years from now, I still want to be a Weight Watcher, still working out, and still feeling great.</p>

			I have been an avid runner for almost ten years.  I ran my first marathon three years ago in Philadelphia, and in 2006, I decided to run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run for the first time.  After running my first marathon, I was looking for a shorter, more &ldquo;fun&rdquo; run.  I had heard great things about the Blue Cross Broad Street Run &#150; great supporters, live music, and an overall great crowd of runners!  I remember the first Blue Cross Broad Street Run I ran &#150; the number of runners at the starting line was amazing!  The sight of all those runners made me so excited &#150; plus the crowd of supporters lining Broad Street for the entire ten miles, along with the lively music and overall positive and fun environment was terrific.  It was one of the best running experiences of my life!  This year will be the third time I will be running the Blue Cross Broad Street Run, and I cannot wait until Sunday, May 4th!  It is one of my favorite runs and I look forward to it every year.</p>

			This is going to be my first year running, and I am doing it with a magnificent bunch of ladies and a trainer that believes that everyone can achieve a goal if they set their mind to it. The ladies I run with are from all walks of life and all sizes. Each of us runs for different reasons, but the one goal we all have in common is to finish this race and be proud of our accomplishment.</p>

			My friend and I have been running and working out together for about four years.  We run several 5K races each year and train together on average four days a week.  We are both lifetime Weight Watchers&rsquo; members and work hard to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle.  This year we are turning 40, and we decided to enter the Blue Cross Broad Street Run to celebrate our milestone birthday.  Of course we won&rsquo;t be setting any records, but we look forward to the sense of accomplishment we are sure to feel when we cross that finish line together.</p>

		  I started running because I was in love with this girl. I started dating her and one of her favorite pastimes is running. She told me she was going to run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run and I thought that was so amazing! After hearing her wonderful stories about the race,  I had to run it the next year. On top of the desire to run my first &ldquo;real-deal&rdquo; road race, I had a powerful longing to be with this girl for the rest of my life, so I had the plan: to propose to her at the finish line of the 2007 Blue Cross Broad Street Run!</p>
		  <p>At that point, I hadn't even run a mile, but I had a year to train and I had motivation to spare. I pounded the pavement with my dream girl several days a week, feeling like I was holding her back, but with her cheering me on, as she always has.  Eventually we increased my mileage and we were on point for the 10 miler. We trained hard, through rain, 13 degree mornings, snow, and a couple of injuries that threatened to thwart my carefully thought-out plans. But, like we always do, we kept holding each other up and pushing each other along and celebrating our accomplished goals. Our running became a metaphor for our life together. Through the good times and the bad, injuries and victories, we always did it together, hand-in-hand.</p>
		  <p>Finally race day came and the experience was more than I ever dreamed it could be. The people, the city, all went by in a blur, as I was lost in the wonderful moment. I had almost forgotten my plan for the finish line!  And through one year of training, one crowded subway ride, ten of the most memorable miles I will ever step, nervous beyond belief, we crossed the finish line, beginning our life together hand-in-hand. (She said YES!)</p>
		  <p>I love this race.<br />See you there in 08!</p>
		  <p>P.S. Attached photo is of us in the car after the race!  So happy!</p>

			I am writing on behalf of a friend that is one of the most inspirational athletes I have ever known. Michael Yancy is a 19-year-old who suffered a spinal cord injury approximately three years ago.  His injury caused him to be quadrapeligic.  Thanks to advances in surgery, and exceptional care at Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, he is able to use his arms and highly motivated to return to his competitive lifestyle.  In highschool, Michael competed in track and field, football, and wrestling.  I told him that I was going to run in the Broad Street Run, and in a disapointed tone, he expressed to me how much he would love to train and &ldquo;run&rdquo; along side me.  Unfortunately, he does not have a wheelchair that he can use to train with or compete in, and his resources are limited to obtain one.  I am hoping that someone somewhere would like to &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; or help this young athlete to obtain a hand cycle wheelchair. He is eager to compete and is a great person.  My name is Chris, just a good friend trying to help.  Please feel free to contact me &#150; Michael gave me permission to use his name in this story, but he does not know that I am trying to help him find a chair for him to use.  Thank you!!</p>

		  <p>I am running in honor of my best friend Dottie Boyle-Person who lost her life on April 2, 2007 at 32 years of age after a yearlong struggle with stage 4 melanoma.  Dottie was in her eight month of pregnancy with her fifth child when doctors diagnosed her disease.  She gave birth to her son early by C-section so she could start chemotherapy.</p>
		  <p>Dottie truly embraced life with love and laughter, and she truly loved being a wife and mother to her  five children. She was an amazing example of tremendous faith and courage.  Graduating from Temple University in Philadelphia as an occupational therapist and growing up in King of Prussia, PA, she was a true lover of Philly and LOVED to run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run.  Everyone that knew Dottie was touched by her contagious hugs and love of life, and she continues to inspire us from heaven. Her husband Andy and their children are shining examples of courage, faith, and hope.</p>
		  <p>Dottie lives on in my heart everyday.  I am thankful for having known and loved her. I run this race in her memory, and to honor her life. This one is for you Dottie!</p>

		  <p><strong>Joan Woltemate &#150; Philadelphia, PA</strong><br/>
			I was post-menopausal at 50, and weighed 150 lbs at 5'6". I privately resolved to turn my life around. In August 06, I began strength training with a personal trainer; I ran my first 5K in April 06. In May, I was a spectator at the 2007 Blue Cross Broad Street Run, and as I watched the late finishers cross the finish line, I made a commitment to myself &#150; that I will run and finish the 2008 Blue Cross Broad Street Run. That same month, I met Michael, a 2-time-All-American-turned-long-distance runner, who convinced me that if I trained right, I would not only run the Broad Street Run, but also the Philadelphia Distance Run (PDR) (in 9/07) and the Philadelphia Marathon (in 11/07)! I thought that was utterly hilarious! But with Michael's coaching, support, and encouragement, I joined the Philadelphia Galloway running group and began training regularly. I crossed the finish line of the PDR in September, with Michael holding up my hand in victory. In November, the Philadelphia Marathon became the first marathon that I ran and finished. I still stand 5'6" but I now weigh 115 lbs. The Blue Cross Broad Street Run holds a special meaning for me. It is &ldquo;The Race&rdquo; that I coveted from the very beginning...it is what inspired me to train hard. I am now ready for it, and on Sunday, May 4, 2008, at 8:30 A.M., I will be among thousands of runners at the start line of the 29th Annual Blue Cross Broad Street Run. Watch for me at the finish line!</p>
