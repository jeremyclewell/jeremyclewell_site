      <h1>Safety and Prevention</h1>
      <h2>Stretches for the lower body</h2>
      <div class="innerImage"> <img src="/htdocs/custom/bcbsr2008/newsletter2/images/layout/safety_2nd_ed.jpg" title="Feature Article" />
	  <p class="subtitle">Stretch to prepare your legs for strenuous exercise.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Stretching can keep your legs limber and your joints pain free.</p>
      <p>Keep these guidelines in mind when doing them:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Start out slowly and build repetitions gradually.</li>
      	<li>Stop any exercise that causes pain.</li>
      	<li>Repeat each exercise three to five times.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Lower back</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Sitting knee-to-chest &mdash; Sit in a straight-back chair with your feet on the floor. Grasp your left knee with both hands and bring that leg up toward your chest. Hold, return to the starting position, and repeat with your right leg.</li>
      	<li>Full-body stretch &mdash; Lie on your back with your legs extended downward and your arms extended above your head. Try to make your body longer by stretching your legs as far as they can reach while extending your arms in the opposite direction. Relax and repeat.</li>
      	<li>Sitting lower back &mdash; Sit in a chair with your legs bent at the knees and slightly apart. Relax your lower back, bend at the hips, and let your arms hang toward the floor. Bend forward until your stomach touches your thighs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Thighs</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Front of thigh &mdash; Hold on to something for balance. Standing on one leg, bend the knee of the other leg and grasp the foot behind you. Keep your knee pointing down (not out to the side). Pull up with light pressure. You do NOT need to pull up all the way to your buttocks. If it feels uncomfortable or painful, you are putting too much strain on the knee joint. Hold your foot behind you for 10 &ndash; 20 seconds, then switch sides.</li>
      	<li>Outer thigh &mdash; Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Bend one knee and draw the foot toward yourself. Cross the foot over the straight leg and place it on the floor on the outside of the other knee. Place your opposite elbow against the raised knee and gently twist away from your bent leg.</li>
      	<li>Inner thigh &mdash; Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, side by side. Let your knees fall open to the sides and allow the soles of your feet to touch. Put your hands on your knees and gently press your knees toward the floor. Hold for a count of eight and release.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Knees</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Stand with your feet separated 12 to 18 inches, one in front of the other and toes pointed forward. Slowly shift your weight forward, bending the knee that&rsquo;s out in front, and keeping the heel of the back foot on the floor. You should feel the resistance in the muscle on the back of your calves. Switch legs and repeat.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Lower leg</h2>
      <ul>
      	<li>Achilles tendon/calf &mdash; Stand two or three feet from a wall. Lean forward with both hands touching the wall, one foot forward, and the other 12 to 18 inches behind. Leave both feet flat on the floor during the stretch. After a 30-second hold (or three 10-second holds), switch legs, and repeat.</li>
      	<li>Stair-step calf-raise &mdash; Stand on a stair step with the toes of both feet near the edge. Position your heels below the level of the step, and then rise on your toes. Hold the stretch and slowly return to the starting position.</li>
      </ul>
