      <h2>Conditioning strategies for peak athletic performance</h2>
	   <div class="innerImage"> <img src="/htdocs/custom/bcbsr2008/newsletter2/images/layout/expert_advice_2nd_ed.jpg" title="Feature Article" />
        <p class="subtitle">Condition head to toe for strength and power.</p>
      </div>
      <p>No matter what sport or athletic activity you pursue, conditioning will make you better at it.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Every athletic pursuit is a power event, whether it&rsquo;s hitting a ball or riding a bike up a hill,&rdquo; says Wayne L. Westcott, Ph.D., fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass. &ldquo;In addition to working on the specific skills of the sport, you also want to build up the power you need to get the job done faster, harder, and better.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You increase your power in two key ways:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>resistance training, such as working with weights, to build basic muscle strength;</li>
      	<li>stretching, to increase flexibility and improve your range of motion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The benefits of stronger, more flexible muscles apply to any sport by giving you endurance and injury protection.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also important to maintain a good level of cardiovascular conditioning through regular aerobic workouts,&rdquo; says Dr. Westcott. Cardio training helps you process oxygen and produce energy at a higher level, so you can play your sport with less effort and for a longer period.</p>
      <h2>Creating power</h2>
      <p>Strength training and flexibility exercises work together to create a more effective driving action. This advantage is especially noticeable in baseball, golf, tennis and other sports that involve brief, explosive activity. You&rsquo;ll see a measurable improvement in both force and range.</p>
      <p>One recent study found that golfers who did strength training increased their club-head speed by 2.6 percent. And those who also did flexibility exercises improved their speed by 5.2 percent.</p>
      <h2>Head-to-toe conditioning</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;The best strategy is to condition all of your muscles, no matter what your sport,&rdquo; says Dr. Westcott. &ldquo;Otherwise, the muscles you ignore become weak links and subject to injury.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be an elite athlete to benefit from good conditioning,&rdquo; says Dr. Westcott. &ldquo;Better strength and flexibility make the activity more enjoyable, no matter what your level of competition.&rdquo;</p>
