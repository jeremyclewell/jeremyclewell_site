      <h1>Running with a Life</h1>
      <h2>The runner&rsquo;s lexicon</h2>

	  <p class="subtitle">You&rsquo;re going to run the run, now learn to talk the talk.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Running has a language all its own.</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Aerobic: Exercise at an intensity that's easy for your respiratory and cardiovascular systems to deliver all or most of the oxygen required by your muscles, and slow enough that lactic acid doesn't appreciably build up in your muscles. Generally, you can sustain a slow aerobic pace for long periods of time, provided you have the endurance to go long distances. 70 &ndash; 80 percent of your maximum heart rate.</li>
      	<li>Anaerobic: Exercise at an intensity that makes it impossible for your respiratory and cardiovascular systems to deliver all or most of the oxygen required by your muscles, and fast enough that lactic acid begins to build up in your muscles, thus producing a tired, heavy feeling. The pace associated with anaerobic running cannot be sustained very long. 80 &ndash; 90 percent of your maximum heart rate.</li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.ibx.com/bcbsr2008/newsletter1/article_expert_advice.html" title="Belly breathing">Belly breathing</a>: Breathing technique that prevents shortness of breath. It does so by increasing movement of the diaphragm and allowing more air into and out of the lungs. </li>
      	<li>Body glide: A lubricating skin product to prevent chafing and skin irritation.</li>
      	<li><a href="https://ecom.ibx.com/ibx/htdocs/wellness/online_tools/bodyMassIndex.html" title="Body Mass Index (BMI)">Body Mass Index (BMI)</a>: The percentage of body fat in proportion to lean body mass (i.e., bone, muscle, tissue, organs, and blood).</li>
      	<li>Carbo-loading: Eating a high carbohydrate diet leading up to an event to fill the body&rsquo;s glycogen stores and prevent the onset of fatigue during a race.</li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.ibx.com/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter1/article_expert_advice_ken_turner.html" title="Fartlek">Fartlek</a>: A training technique in which periods of intense effort alternate with periods of less strenuous effort in a continuous workout.</li>
      	<li>Glycogen: The form in which carbohydrates are stored in the body. There are two main stores of glycogen &mdash; the liver and the muscles. When glycogen stores are depleted, athletes fatigue. Stores can be maximally filled by eating a high carbohydrate diet leading up to an event (carbo-loading).</li>
      	<li>Glucose: The form of sugar into which all carbohydrates are first converted and appear in the blood.</li>
      	<li>Heart rate monitor: A device that measures the electrical activity of the heart; usually consists of a chest strap and watch-like wrist receiver.</li>
      	<li>Hyponatremia: Also known as &ldquo;water intoxication&rsquo;. It is the opposite of dehydration. Hyponatremia can occur when the water content in the body increases and the sodium levels decrease (through sweat). This can interfere with brain, heart, and muscle function. <a href="http://www.ibx.com/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter6/hydration_formula.html" title="Calculate your water needs">Calculate your water needs</a>.</li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.ibx.com/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter1/article_expert_advice_ken_turner.html" title="Interval training">Interval training</a>: Running fast a number of times over short distances, with a slow recovery jog between runs. The fast runs should push the body to its VO2 max (maximum oxygen consumption).</li>
      	<li>Kick: A finishing sprint at the end of a race.</li>
      	<li>Kilometer: Equal to .62 mile.</li>
      	<li>Mile: Equal to 1,609 meters; 5,280 feet; or 1,760 yards. Note: 1,600 meters (four times around most tracks) is not a mile.</li>
      	<li>Overtraining: Training too hard, too frequently. This leads to fatigue, injury, and/or burn-out.</li>
      	<li>Recovery runs: Slow to moderate running to recover from hard workouts or races and/or maintain aerobic conditioning.</li>
      	<li>RICE: An acronym for rest, ice, compression, and elevation; a common procedure for treating injuries.</li>
      	<li>Runner&rsquo;s high: A feeling of euphoria some runners feel after a long, hard run or race.</li>
      	<li>Heart rate: A measurement that determines a runner&rsquo;s overall effort. It is based on age and overall fitness. Determine <a href="https://ecom.ibx.com/ibx/htdocs/wellness/online_tools/targetHeartRate.html" title="Determine your target heart rate">your target heart rate</a>.</li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.ibx.com/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter3/article_gear_check.html" title="Training log">Training log</a>: A record of your training and running that helps runners stay motivated, monitor progress, and spot trends in running.</li>
      	<li>Second wind: The feeling of more energy and less effort some runners feel after 15 &ndash; 20 minutes of running.</li>
      	<li>Splits: The time it takes to run a portion of a total run (often measured at mile markers or other distinctive points along the way); for example, a runner may run a 7:00 mile split between miles 4 and 5 of a 10K (6.2-mile run)</li>
      	<li>Tapering: Reducing training mileage several days to three weeks before an important race to ensure peak performance on race day.</li>
      	<li><a href="http://www.ibx.com/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter1/article_expert_advice_ken_turner.html" title="Threshold runs">Threshold runs</a>: A running pace just above easy and right below hard. It&rsquo;s the pace that a runner can maintain for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
      	<li>VO2 max: The maximum amount of oxygen that can be utilized by the body.</li>
      	<li>Wicking: Refers to the property of synthetic fabrics and clothes that are designed to move moisture and sweat away from skin.</li>
