      <h1>Safety and Prevention</h1>
      <h2>This one’s dedicated to all the lone runners out there — <em>you know who you are</em>.</h2>
	  <p class="subtitle">It is Daylight Savings Time. Try and schedule your run while it is still light outside.</p><br />

      <p>If you’re a lone runner, you’re pretty sure that running alone is the only acceptable way to run. For you, it is, by far, the most perfect part of your day. It’s the best time to get lost in thought or to completely zone out. It’s your escape from just about everything. Before you head out for your next run, though, here’s some sage advice for all runners.</p><br />
      <p>Run in very public areas (places that always have some form of pedestrian or street traffic)</p><br />
        <p>Carry a protective spray (like pepper spray or Mace), a whistle, or a high-decibel personal alarm.</p><br />
        <p>Glance over your shoulder occasionally. Know what is going on behind you, and send a clear signal to everyone around you that you’re paying attention.</p><br />
        <p>Take the long way home. Skip shortcuts though alleys, parking lots, and drive-through lanes (and don’t even think of cutting behind the food store; you know, the one with the loading docks and dumpsters).</p><br />
        <p>Change your route frequently, especially if you run at exactly the same time every day.</p><br />
		<p>Carry a cell phone, ID, and house key with you, in case of emergency.</p><br />
		<p>If you are followed, go to the nearest residence, open business, or group of people.</p><br />
		<p>Take advantage of Daylight Savings Time and run in the early evening, while the Sun is still up.</p><br />
      <p>While we wholeheartedly agree that music makes a run go faster, relaxing to your favorite tunes may also put you at risk. Here are some ideas to keep you safe when you’re wearing a headset:</p><br />
	  <p>Keep the volume low enough to hear traffic and sirens.</p><br />
		<p>Free your hands. There are countless armbands, belt clips, and even sunglasses, designed to hold your music player. Though we hope you never need them, your hands should be free and ready to use your pepper spray or Mace.</p><br />
		<p>Remember, you can run in the dark; you can run with your musicâ€¦<em>but, you should not run in the dark with your music!</em></p><br />
