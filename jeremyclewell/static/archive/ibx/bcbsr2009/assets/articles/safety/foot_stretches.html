      <p>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society recommends doing these simple exercises to strengthen your toes and prevent foot discomfort.</p><br />
      <p>Toe raise, toe point, toe curl: Hold each position for five seconds and repeat ten times. Recommended for people with hammertoes or toe cramps.</p><br />
      <p>Golf ball roll: Roll a golf ball under the ball of your foot for two minutes. This is a great massage for the bottom of the foot and is recommended for people with plantar fasciitis (heel pain), arch strain, or foot cramps.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Towel curls:</span> Place a small towel on the floor and curl it toward you, using only your toes. You can increase the resistance by putting a weight on the end of the towel. Relax and repeat this exercise five times. Recommended for people with hammertoes, toe cramps, and pain in the ball of the foot.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Sand walking:</span> Any chance you get, take off your shoes and walk in the sand at the beach. This not only massages your feet but strengthens your toes and is good for general foot conditioning.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Marble pick-up:</span> Place about 20 marbles on the floor. Pick up one marble at a time, and put it in a small bowl. Do this exercise until you have picked up all of the marbles. Recommended for people with pain in the ball of the foot, hammertoes, and toe cramps.</p><br />
