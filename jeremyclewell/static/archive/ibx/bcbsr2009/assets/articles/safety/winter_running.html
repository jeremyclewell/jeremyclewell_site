      <h1>Safety and Prevention</h1>
      <h2>Caution: winter running</h2>
	  <p class="subtitle">The cold weather doesn't have to stop your outside training, but be aware of your footwork if you choose to run in ice and snow.</p><br />

      <p>Just because it's cold and icy right now doesn't mean you can't still burn up the road. Just take a few cold-weather precautions.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Layer, layer, layer.</span> Wear appropriate clothes that will keep you warm. Avoid cotton as it can trap moisture and cause chills. Make sure your top layer offers protection from wind, cold, and wetness.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Watch your step.</span> Snow is better than ice. Choose running on the snow over running on ice. Snow will give you more traction.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Listen to your body.</span> If your chest or throat bothers you when you run outdoors, your body is telling you something. Run or cross-train inside!</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Drink water before and after you run.</span> The cold can be particularly deceiving. You can become dehydrated without ever feeling hot or sweaty.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Cold wind? Start against it.</span> Run into the wind when you start your run and come home with the wind at your back. When you turn around, not only will it be a nice relief to have the wind behind you, but you will save yourself from a sweaty and chilly trip home. As soon as you get home, be sure to get out of your sweaty clothes. Enjoy a hot shower. You've earned it.</p><br />
      <h2>ALWAYS:</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Listen to your body:</span> If you feel an ache or pain, assess the kind of pain. Is it sharp? Is it dull? If you cannot identify the pain, or you feel the pain with every step, <span class="italic">stop running</span>. Stretch out the area. You may just be experiencing a cramp or a mild strain: both of these may cause a tear or a pulled muscle if you are not careful. Running through the pain can lead to not running for weeks.</p><br />
