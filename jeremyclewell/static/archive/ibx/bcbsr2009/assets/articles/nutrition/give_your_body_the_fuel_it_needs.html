      <p>One of the best things runners can do for themselves is to properly fuel their bodies. Whether you run to maintain your overall health and fitness or you are looking to lose some weight, here are some tips about food — how much you should be eating and when you should be eating for optimal running performance.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Stay hydrated.</span> Start drinking water at the beginning of and throughout each day so that you are well hydrated when you are ready to run. Remember, it's a good idea to avoid coffee and alcohol when you're training as they can have a diuretic effect.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Choose your carbohydrates carefully.</span> Carbohydrates are a great source of fuel…but stick to complex carbohydrates (think fruits, vegetables, bread, pasta, and legumes) and avoid simple carbohydrates (think foods that are prepared with sugar, honey, or jelly).</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Try not to run on empty,</span> or your body and performance will suffer. Aim to eat a high-carbohydrate meal or snack about two to four hours before training and a carbohydrate-rich snack shortly after exercise.</p><br />
