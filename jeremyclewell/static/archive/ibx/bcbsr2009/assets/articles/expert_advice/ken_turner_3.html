      <p>It's coming down to the wire, and you only have a month left to train before the big race. Right now, you should be close to 75 percent of the total distance for the race. This means that you should be running 7.5 miles on your long runs. Now is also the time to test your pace. In the next week or so, time your long run to see how you're doing. If you have been training regularly, it should be close to your final race pace. I really recommend running a 5K or a 10K race to see how it feels. Make sure you go out at your own pace and are not swept up with the crowd.</p><br />
      <p>Now is the time to get the last of your speed work in (45-seconds-on/2-minutes-off repeats). You can judge for yourself what you have to do, but remember do not add more than 5 percent of a track workout or timed sprints to your training schedule in this last month. Right now, you are doing maintenance runs and workouts to maintain your fitness level. Do not try anything new or run longer distances at this point as they will only hurt your running and not help you. If you do too much, you'll lose speed and/or endurance.</p><br />
      <p>Keep up the good work. You're doing great! Make sure you use this last month to get the right amount of training and rest so that you are ready to run the one of the best ten-mile races in the country.</p><br />
