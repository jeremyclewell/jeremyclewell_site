      <p>While most of your time this month should be spent running, your efficiency may improve by lifting weights as well. You only need to hit the weights twice a week for about 30 minutes, but those 30 minutes are important. Don't worry about bulking up! The intense aerobic training that you runners do will not allow you to become “The Terminator.”</p><br />
      <p>Benefits of increasing your muscular strength:</p><br />
	  <p><span class="bullet">•</span> You will be able to handle weight loads of greater intensity.</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> You may decrease the risk of joint injury and strains caused by overuse.</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Improved running performance: You will be able to run longer and faster!</p><br />
	<h2>Functional strength training</h2>
      <p>If you are just starting a strength-training program, keep it simple. I would recommend just a few upper and lower body exercises and core work using “functional movements.” Functional training means working the human body as one unit — with your feet on the ground.</p><br />
	  <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Standing up</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Working everything at the same time</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Multi-jointed activities </p><br />
      <p>By doing these types of movements, you work your core and increase your balance at the same time. Here are some suggestions to work into your program:</p><br />
	<p>Two sets (8–12 reps) of the following, twice a week:</p><br />
	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Squats</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> One-legged squats</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Lunges</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Push-ups </p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Triceps dips</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Standing bicep curls with free weights</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Shoulder presses while sitting on a stability ball</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Low rows using cables and from a standing position </p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Hamstring curls lying on your back with feet on a stability ball</p><br />
	<p>Include these next two exercises (hold each for one minute):</p><br />
	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> A standing squat with your back against a stability ball, against the wall.</p><br />
		<p><span class="bullet">•</span> A pike pose (it's like the starting position for a push up) resting on your forearms or up on your hands.</p><br />
	<p>In the end, just remember to have fun and pick exercises that work for you. It is so much more rewarding when you make the most out of “getting there.” </p><br />
