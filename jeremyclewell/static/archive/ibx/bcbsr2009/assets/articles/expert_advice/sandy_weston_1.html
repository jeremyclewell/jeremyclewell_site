      <p>So, are you getting psyched? You should be. </p><br />
      <p>There is nothing like it, and it is here again. No, it is not vacation or your birthday… it's the Broad Street Run! And my job is to help you get you ready for the race with some cross-training ideas. </p><br />
      <p>Balance, balance, balance. I can't say it enough. In life, in fitness — regardless, balance is necessary in everything you do. You know how it feels when you work too much: you don't have enough time for your family, friends, or yourself. Life becomes out-of-whack. The same can happen with your training program. Cross-training is good for your body and mind. I know you need to run the miles, but make sure to supplement some days with other cardiovascular (cardio) exercise, strength work, and flexibility training. What you choose to do is up to you. There is so much available that is new and fun! Whether you choose to take a class, use machines at the gym, or train at home, it is all good as long as you have all three components.</p><br />
      <p>The first thing I am going to concentrate on is bodywork. Yes, just using your own body weight will increase strength and flexibility. This is an “excuse-less” set of exercises. All you need is your body and enough space to lie down.</p><br />
      <p>Let's get started.</p><br />
        <p class="bold">The “Hindu”:</p>
          <p>The emphasis is on the upper body but it works the entire body while increasing flexibility. If you have taken any type of yoga class, you might be familiar with the format.</p><br />
          <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Start on your hands and knees.</p><br />
            <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Bring your body up into a pike position (an upside-down V). Your hands are right under your shoulders, and your feet are flat with your head down and butt sticking up in the air.</p><br />
            <p><span class="bullet">•</span> In one quick swoop, dive down — head first — through your hands with your hips as low to the ground as possible. Hold for a second and then come back up to the pike position.</p><br />
          <p>This will really get your core involved. Make sure you keep your abs and butt tight to support your lower back: this is called neutral position. Never hunch your shoulders: they should be away from your ears.</p><br />
          <p>Goal: 2–3 sets of eight.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Single leg lunges:
          <p>If you want, you can do this exercise with light weights in your hands. The emphasis here (besides core and flexibility) is on the back of the leg: the hamstrings and your buttocks muscles. It is also great for hip flexibility. As runners, you work your quadriceps (front of the thigh) a lot, this is a great exercise to balance out those legs!</p><br />
          <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Start with your arms by your side (weights in hands)</p><br />
            <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Keep one foot on the ground and lift the other leg back while tipping yourself forward. You want to keep your gaze up and your back flat. Your abs and back should be strong with shoulders down. Your goal is to get your body parallel — like a tabletop — with the leg that is up reaching behind you as straight as possible.  Your supporting leg has a slight bend in it, but not much. </p><br />
            <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Return to the starting position by bringing your body upright. If you can, try not to touch the ground with the leg that is in the air — but if you do, no worries. Your balance will get stronger.</p><br />
          <p>Goal: 2–3 sets on each leg: eight reps.</p><br />
          <p>Incorporate these two exercises in your program three times a week.</p><br />
      <p>So there you have it: your first set of exercises, a balance of strength and flexibility. Moreover, don't forget to try another type of cardio, like a spin class or an elliptical machine.</p><br />
