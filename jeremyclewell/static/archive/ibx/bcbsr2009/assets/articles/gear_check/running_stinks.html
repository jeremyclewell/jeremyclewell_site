      <p>What is it about running clothes? They stink. And by now, after a great season of training for the Blue Cross Broad Street Run, your running gear is most likely...fragrant.</p><br />
      <p>Oh sure, they might smell fine when you first pull them out of the dryer, but give them an hour and their super smell returns. Put them on, and you risk passing out. Why not save yourself the embarrassment and torture, and use this time during your recovery week to treat your clothes to some TLC.</p><br />
      <p>Some suggestions for getting the stink out:</p><br />
      <p>Wash clothes as quickly a possible after a run.</p><br />
      <p>Pretreat clothes with detergent made for wool.</p><br />
      <p>Add some baking soda and a little splash of hydrogen peroxide to your regular detergent and use a cold-water wash.</p><br />
      <p>Use a detergent specially formulated for sports clothes:
      <p>Penguin Sport-Wash®, Win High Performance Sport Detergent, or SportSuds™.</p><br />
      <p>If all else fails... buy some new clothes. You, and everyone running behind you, will thank you!</p><br />
      <p>Happy trails!</p><br />
