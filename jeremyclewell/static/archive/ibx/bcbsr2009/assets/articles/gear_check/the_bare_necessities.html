      <h2>The bare necessities: the foundation of a good run</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Your "undies" are just as important as your other running clothes. You want undergarments that are comfortable and supportive for your training.</p><br />

      <p>The importance of a runner's undergarments can't be overemphasized. Nope, they're not pretty, and they're not even all that flattering (and their ability to retain odor defies all detergents), but they hold the key to a comfortable and enjoyable run. Before you set one foot on the road or the treadmill, check what you've got going on under there and consider these guidelines:</p><br />
      <p>Choose undergarments made of fabrics that move sweat away from the skin to the outer surface of the fabric (also called wicking), where it evaporates.</p><br />
      <p>Explore all your undergarment options. Shop at a running or sporting-goods store for a wide selection.</p><br />
      <p class="bold">Sports bras </p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Running bras are often sized differently than everyday bras. Make sure you try on a bra before you buy it.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> A good running bra should have a snug fit. It should not ride up when you swing your arms.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Look for bras that are seamless with no stitching. They reduce your chances of chafing.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Look for bras made with fabrics that wick. This is great for moisture control and also reduces chafing.</p><br />
      <p class="bold">Underwear*</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Many styles of briefs/panties are available for both men and women in stretchy fabrics that wick. Look for seamless construction.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Running shorts have a built-in underwear liner. Rule of thumb: If they do not have a liner, they probably are not running shorts.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Compression shorts aren't known to have liners (think biker shorts). These, too, should be made of fabric that wicks. They are great for preventing chafing and keeping your pants from riding up.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="bold">Shirts and Ts</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> A word of caution: Often new runners, and even a couple of us old-schoolers, fall prey to the cotton T-shirt trap. Sure, cotton is soft and comfortable, but the minute you start to sweat, it will become wet, heavy, and clingy, and rub you in all the wrong places.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> Look for seamless, wicking fabrics with a comfortable fit.</p><br />
            <p>* We use this term loosely. Traditional everyday "underwear" is usually made of cotton and therefore not suitable for running, as it easily chafes.</p><br />
