     <h2>How to lace before you race</h2>

     <p>You probably haven't given much thought to the way you lace your sneakers. Shoe lacing is the kind of thing you learned in kindergarten and then took for granted.</p><br />
	 <p>But experts say shoe lacing makes a difference. It's just one of many simple things you can do to safeguard your feet while you put them through the demands of an athletic workout. Simply lacing your sneakers properly, along with choosing a sneaker that fits your foot correctly, can add comfort to your stride and prevent foot injuries.</p><br />
	 <p>Shoelaces are an ancient invention, but they do an admirable job of keeping the foot securely positioned within the shoe, says the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society. The society recommends thinking of your sneakers as a corset. The laces let the corset in and out and allow a good fit.</p><br />
	 <p>Improper fit and poor lacing technique are a dangerous combination. They can cause a variety of foot ills, from blisters and hammertoes to chronic heel bruises and even stress fractures.</p><br />
	 <h2>How to lace your shoes</h2>
	 <p>Once you've got the basic fit down, turn your attention to the laces. Here is the proper lacing technique:</p><br />
	 <p>Loosen the laces as you put on the shoes. This prevents stress on the eyelets and the backs of the shoes. In fact, take all the laces out when trying on a pair of shoes and re-lace with equal tension.</p><br />
	 <p>Always begin at the bottom and pull the laces using one set of eyelets at a time to tighten the shoes. This prevents stress at the tops of the shoes and aids a better fit.</p><br />
	 <p>When choosing shoes, keep in mind that those with more eyelets allow a more custom fit. Athletic shoes tend to allow more of a custom fit than, say, wingtips.</p><br />
	 <p>The old standby method of lacing — crisscross to the top of the shoe — works best for about 75 percent of athletic shoe wearers.</p><br />
	 <p>For wide feet: Use the eyelets closer to the tongue of the shoe. This allows greater width to the lacing area and has the same effect as letting out a corset.</p><br />
	 <p>For narrow heel and wider forefoot: A narrow heel and wider forefoot is a common problem among women. Consider using two laces for a combination fit. Use the closer set of eyelets to adjust the width of the shoe at the forefoot and the wider set to snug up the heel to prevent the heel from acting like a piston.</p><br />
	 <p>For foot pain: If you have a high arch, bump on the top of your foot, a bone that sticks out, nerve pain, or tendon injury, try leaving a space in the lacing to alleviate pressure. Simply skip the eyelets near the point of pain.</p><br />
