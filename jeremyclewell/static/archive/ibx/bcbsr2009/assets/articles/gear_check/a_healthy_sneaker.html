      <p>They are your single most important — and probably most expensive — piece of running equipment. Here are some suggestions for taking care of your running sneakers.</p><br />
      <p>Prevent odors by letting your sneakers air out completely between runs.</p><br />
      <p>Extend the life of your sneakers by using them for running only. Wearing them throughout the day adds unnecessary miles.</p><br />
      <p>Hand wash with mild soap when necessary. Remove inserts and laces. Air dry.</p><br />
      <p>Change your sneakers every 3 months or 300 miles.</p><br />
      <p>Be sure to check your sneakers regularly for damage and wear. Make sure there is sufficient cushioning and a sole that is in good shape. If not, it's time to invest in a new pair.</p><br />
