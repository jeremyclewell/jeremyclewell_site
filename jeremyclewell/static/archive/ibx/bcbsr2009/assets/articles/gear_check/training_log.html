      <h2>How and why to keep a training log</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A training log can be a powerful tool and motivator to help you get the most from your workouts.</p><br />

      <p>Some people like to train intensely for peak performance. Others simply enjoy getting out and doing what they can. Either way, a <a href="/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter3/images/pdfs/weekly_run_log.pdf" title="Download a Runner&rsquo;s Log">training log</a> is a tool that can help you get more from your workout.</p><br />
	  <p>"Think of a training log as a planning tool," says Judith C. Young, Ph.D., executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education in Reston, VA. "It helps you organize and save information about your exercise routine, so you can work toward whatever you think is important."</p><br />
	  <p>For example, if you're training for a marathon, keeping a log can help you track how you run under various weather conditions or when you're following a special diet. You can record information about the nicest routes if you're walking to enjoy the scenery.</p><br />
	  <p>Your log also can prod you to work out on those days when you're too tired or you think you're too busy.</p><br />
	  <h2>What to record</h2>
	  <p>Here's a brief rundown on what data you should record:</p><br />
	  <h2>Your physical and mental condition</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Heart rate.</span> Take two readings: one before you begin exercising and one at peak activity. Be sure to stay within your target heart rate range.</p>
      <br />
      <p><span class="bold">Hours of sleep.</span> See how this entry affects your performance.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Weight.</span> You'll notice regular exercise helps you lose extra pounds and maintain a healthful weight.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Diet.</span> You may discover certain foods improve your performance.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Discomforts.</span> Note unusual aches or pains.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Mood.</span> Record how you felt at the start of a workout, then mention whether the workout changed your mood.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Thoughts and feelings.</span> Exercise frees many people from everyday worries and helps them use their minds more creatively. Let your thoughts flow from pen to paper.</p><br />
      <h2>Workout conditions</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Day and time.</span> This information gives you a frame of reference and helps you maintain consistency.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Weather.</span> Hot, cool, humid, or pleasant? Noting this information will tell you under which conditions you work best.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Road surface or equipment condition.</span> Jot down a brief description for future reference.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Atmosphere.</span> Pretty scenery may improve your performance, while a crowded gym may increase your tension.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Your activity.</span> Note the route you walked or ran, the training machines you used, or the aerobic exercises you completed.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Things to avoid.</span> Note which house has the loud, crabby dog or what time of day a pool's lap lanes are crowded.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Favorite things.</span> Jot down a route you'd like to run or walk again, or note a pair of really comfortable shoes.</p><br />
      <p>If you're diligent about maintaining a training log, you're not just recording what you're doing but also recording your progress, and that can be a powerful motivator. "Sometimes you may feel you're not making much progress; your log book will prove otherwise, right there in your own handwriting," Dr. Young says. "That can be enough to give you a second wind."</p><br />
