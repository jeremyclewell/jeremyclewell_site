      <h1>Gear Check</h1>
      <h2>What's in your bag?</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Pack smart and use the bag-check service on race day.</p><br />

      <p>Like many distance races, the Blue Cross Broad Street Run offers a gear check service for runners. This convenient service shuttles your gym or duffle bag from the starting area to the finish line.</p><br />
      <p>Not only does this mean that you can wear sweats before the start of the race, but you can also bring along some dry clothes, socks, and shoes for post-race.</p><br />
      <p class="bold">Things you might want to pack:</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> change of socks, shoes, or sandals</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> change of clothes</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> a hat</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> favorite sports recovery bar</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> sunglasses/sunscreen</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> wet wipes</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> tissues</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> extra safety pins for attaching the race bib</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> band aids</p><br />
      <p class="bold">Things not to pack in your gym bag:*</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> money</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> cell phone</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> keys</p><br />
      <p>* We realize that many runners need these items for race day. In those cases, we suggest wearing an elastic waist pouch (it's like a fanny-pack that doesn't bounce around) on race day. Also, while tying keys to shoelaces is a common practice of runners, please realize the risk you run of loosing your keys.</p><br />
      <h2>How to use the gear check</h2>
      <p>Look for the yellow school busses above the start line area.</p><br />
      <p>Bring your own gym or duffel bag for your gear.</p><br />
      <p>Mark your bag with the tag supplied on race day. Any bag that is not properly marked will not be accepted.</p><br />
      <p>Place your bag on the bus that displays the number that corresponds to your race bib. This system is designed to help you locate your bag at the finish area.</p><br />
      <p>At the finish, display your official race number to the volunteers and your items will be returned. Please be patient and courteous, as this is a big job for our volunteers to handle.</p><br />
