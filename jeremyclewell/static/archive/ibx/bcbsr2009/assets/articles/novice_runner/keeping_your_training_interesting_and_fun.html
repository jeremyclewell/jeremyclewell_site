      <h2>Keeping your training interesting and fun</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Partner-training is a great way to keep your runs fun and interesting. Plus, you are far less likely to skip a workout if you know your friend is at the park waiting for you. </p>

      <p>You've been training for a few weeks now, so the novelty of running might be starting to wear off. Waking up extra early may be getting a little harder, and the thought of bundling up to run outside after work is not as exciting. Well, you can put your worry and self-doubt away! This is perfectly normal. All it means is that the novelty of running is over and you are getting into the routine of your training program. Occasionally, not every runner feels like running. Like everything thing else, running has its lulls. But it's up to you to get yourself back in the game. Try these suggestions:</p><br />
      <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Find a partner.</span> A running partner will keep you honest. If you know that someone is relying on you to show up, you will be far less likely to skip your scheduled run. Running with a partner also can make longer runs go a lot faster.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Run a race.</span> Check out some of the upcoming races listed in the <a href="/htdocs/custom/bsr/newsletter2/local_clubs.html" title ="Fun Runs">Tools</a> section. Sometimes planning to run a shorter distance race before you run the Blue Cross Broad Street Run will help reinvigorate your training.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Play games.</span> Maybe getting out there is not the problem. Maybe you're just bored while you're running. Try tricking your brain: run as fast as you can to the tree or stop light, count three new things you have never seen before on that particular route, or catch up to a person running ahead of you. Your run will be over faster than you think.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bullet">•</span> <span class="bold">Play with the buttons.</span> If you are on a treadmill (which is notorious for being boring), start playing with the buttons: increase your speed, give yourself an incline, or race your fellow treadmill runner (if you're at a gym). Not only will you finish a lot faster, but you will increase the efficiency of your workout (read about Interval Training by Coach Ken Turner).</p>
