      <h2>Components of a balanced exercise program</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A well-rounded fitness program can help you achieve maximum results.</p>

      <p>A good exercise program has three components: aerobic activity, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Each of these benefits your body in a different way.</p><br />
      	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Aerobic activity improves your cardio-respiratory endurance, that is, the ability of your heart, lungs, blood vessels, and associated tissue to use oxygen to produce energy for activity. Activities include running, jogging, bicycling, swimming, power-walking, racquet sports, and rowing.</p><br />
<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Resistance exercises strengthen your muscles and bones and improve your body's ratio of lean muscle mass to fat. The stronger your muscles, the longer you will be able to keep going during aerobic activity and the less the chance you will have of getting injured. Activities include Pilates, elastic band, weight machine, and free-weight workouts.</p><br />
      	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Flexibility training keeps your muscles stretched and your joints limber. Flexibility training has been shown to increase range of motion and decrease muscle soreness associated with exercise; it may also decrease exercise-related injury. Activities include traditional static stretching, yoga, and Pilates.<br />
      </p>
   	  <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
      <p>Following the recommendations outlined by the surgeon general, you can build your program and determine which activities you will do each day and for how long.</p><br />
      <h4>Every day</h4>
      	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Aerobic activity: at least 30 minutes of moderately vigorous exercise</p><br />
      	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Flexibility training: at least 5–10 minutes. 
   	  Stretching can be incorporated into your warm-up before both aerobic and strength-training workouts. Keep in mind, however, that stretching "cold" before a workout will help you limber up, but it won't permanently lengthen your muscles or connective tissues. To achieve lasting effects, you need to stretch several times a week after your muscles are fully warmed up.<br />
      </p>
   	  <h4>Twice a week</h4>
      	<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Strength training: at least two sessions a week of strength exercises that include: 8 – 10 different exercises using the major muscle groups of the legs, trunk, chest, and shoulders. One or two sets of 8 – 12 repetitions each.</p>
<br />
        <p>Together, these activities are the foundation for your exercise program. As your body adapts to this routine and it becomes fairly easy to accomplish, gradually make your workout more difficult. You can do this by adding repetitions, weight, or sets, or increasing intensity.</p><br />
