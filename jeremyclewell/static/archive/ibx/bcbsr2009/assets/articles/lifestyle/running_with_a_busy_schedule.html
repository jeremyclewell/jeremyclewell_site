      <p>Now that you've made the commitment to run the Broad Street Run, training must become a part of your daily routine. Some days it will be easy â€” you can get someone to watch the kids, or you have a long lunch. Other days will be next to impossible. With a little creative planning, you can avoid the roadblocks between you and your run.</p><br />
      <h2>A crazy workday:</h2><br />
    <p><span class="bold">Plan ahead.</span> For example, if you know your Mondays are packed with meetings or you usually work late, plan to make Mondays an easier workout day. Get a 20-minute run in first thing in the morning, then call it a day. Tuesday or Wednesday can be a longer run.</p><br />
        <p><span class="bold">Become a morning person.</span> Sometimes you can't control how a workday will unfold. If a crisis occurs at work, you may not be able to get out for that lunch run. Taking care of your run in the morning ensures that work won't get in the way later.</p><br />
        <h2>The kids:</h2><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Make a trade.</span> Work something out with your spouse to watch the kids for an hour after work, and you can get them ready for school in the morning, or vice versa.</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Play a game.</span> Take your kids to a nearby track and run around the track with them. Take them to the park, chase them, and let them chase you. Kids have boundless energy! Use it to your advantage!</p><br />
      <p><span class="bold">Pay the sitter.</span> Hire a babysitter for an hour, twice a week, to make sure you get two good runs in. You might also want to consider joining a gym that offers child care. If you are paying someone, you will definitely be committed to a run that day.</p><br />
