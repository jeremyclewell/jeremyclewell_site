      <h2>Adding variety to your workout: a recipe for success</h2>
	  <p class="subtitle">Choose cross-training activities that you enjoy, and chances are you'll stick with them longer.</p><br />

      <p>Doing the same exercise day in and day out can lead to boredom and burnout. To keep your workout interesting, do what many athletes do: mix up your workout by adding new activities.</p><br />
      <p>Instead of jogging four times a week, for instance, you could jog two days and bike or swim two days. You also can incorporate strength training and stretching exercises into your routine. The idea is to keep your exercise routine fresh and interesting by providing variety, according to the Physician and Sports Medicine journal.</p><br />
	  <h2>Many choices</h2>
	  <p>Think of cross training as an exercise buffet. When you visit the buffet table, you probably don't just fill up on your favorite food time after time. You sample. The same goes for exercise. There are countless activities to get your heart going, from walking to dancing to rowing to cross-country skiing. All of them help you stay in shape as long as they're done with enough vigor to increase your respiration and heart rate.</p>
	  <br />
	 <p>Cross training also can cut injuries. Many sports injuries result from doing the same repetitive motion. Altering your routine avoids the same stresses on the body and allows you to develop your entire body rather than just specific portions.</p><br />
	 <p>Here are several factors to consider when setting up a cross-training routine.</p><br />
	 <h2>Enjoyment</h2>
	 <p>Choose activities that you find fun. If you like them, chances are you'll keep on doing them.</p><br />
	 <h2>Balance</h2>
	 <p>When it comes to physical exertion, spread the burden around. If you primarily do lower body activities like running, think about adding an upper body workout such as rowing or weightlifting several times a week to engage some different muscles.</p><br />
	 <h2>Variety</h2>
	 <p>Even within your allotted time for aerobic exercise, you can do more than one activity. For instance, you can jog for 20 minutes, and then ride a stationary bike for 20 minutes. That keeps your mind from wandering and gives different muscles a good workout.</p><br />
	 <h2>Total fitness</h2>
	 <p>Fitness has four components: cardiovascular endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. Ideally, you want to work on each of those areas sometime during the week. Aerobic exercises such as walking, swimming, or biking work the cardiovascular system. Strength training can mean lifting weights, climbing stairs, or using resistance machines. Stretching or yoga develops flexibility. Yoga or dancing improves balance.</p><br />
	 <h2>Time</h2>
	 <p>Don't think of adding but replacing activities. Most people have limited time to exercise. Cross-training allows you to replace your normal workout or part of your normal workout with different activities.</p><br />
