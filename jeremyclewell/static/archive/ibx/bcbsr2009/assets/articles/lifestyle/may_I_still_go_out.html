      <p>It's Friday night. It's happy hour. But you waffle. You waver. Should you go? May you drink? Will it set you back days in your training? So many runners struggle with their conscience about going out while training for a race. Struggle no more! The answer is yes! Of course you may go out, <span class="italic">but</span> (ah-hah, you knew this was coming)... you will need to be more aware of what you are putting into your body.</p><br />
      <p>The Dietary Guidelines, produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, recommend no more than two drinks a day for men and no more than one drink a day for women.¹ In fact, one glass of wine a day may be beneficial to your health.² Unfortunately, holding yourself to one drink while out for hours can be really tough. Here are some ways to limit your drinking while still having fun:</p><br />
      <p>Drink something that will take a while to finish. People don't typically &quot;chug&quot; wine.</p><br />
      <p>If you are drinking beer, opt for the bottle. A pint of beer is 16 ounces. A bottle of beer is 12 ounces. You might drink less. </p><br />
      <p>Limit your funds. Pay with cash. Bring only enough money to cover one or two drinks. It will force you to make them last.</p><br />
      <p>Follow each alcoholic beverage with a nonalcoholic one. This is a great way to pace yourself and counteract the dehydrating effect alcohol has on your body.</p><br />
      <p>P.S. If you do happen to overdo it, plan your next day carefully. Make sure you reschedule any big runs the next morning. You may be very dehydrated after a night of heavy drinking. If you try to do a long run, you may feel dizzy or nauseous; it could increase your risk of an injury. Drink plenty of fluids the next day and consider walking instead.<br />
